# operator_node

**NOTE**: this branch is kept as reference - it is in the state that I used for the experiments in my [RSS paper](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss17/p028.html).

The `operator_node` package performs parsing from raw interface signals to the required format.

## Install

1. Clone repository
1. `cd` into `operator_node`
1. `$ rosdep update ; rosdep install --from-paths ./ -iry`
1. Build catkin workspace
